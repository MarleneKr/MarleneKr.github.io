    <p>Hi, my name is Marlene and this website will be about a very cute dog named Aiko. He's a Beagle and he's now about one and a half years old. <br> Unfortunately he's not my dog. His owners are the parents of my boyfriend, or rather his brother.
    <br>Every time I am at his parents house, I go for a walk with sweet little Aiko. I love him very much and I am convinced that he loves me too. 
    <br>He is my king, and to prove that, here is a majestic picture of him:</p>
