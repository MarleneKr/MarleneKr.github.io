    <h2>What this website is about</h2>
    <p>
        Hi, my name is Marlene, I go to the university "Campus02" in Graz. I created this website because of an
        assignment in the
        course "Webtechnologien und Usability". This website is about a very cute dog named Aiko.
    </p>

    <h2>Aiko</h2>

    <p>
        Aiko is a Beagle and he's now about one and a half years old. Unfortunately he's not my dog.
        His owners are the parents of my boyfriend, or rather his brother.
        Every time I am at his parents house, I go for a walk with Aiko. I love him very much and I am convinced that he
        loves me too.
        On the left side you can see a picture of him, standing on a wooden bank and on the left side you can see a very
        majestic pricture of him.

        They got him in summer of 2018. Of course, since then he got a lot bigger and heavier. The color of his fur also changed a bit, he now has a darker back than before.
        I really like his fur markings. Especially, his sweet white snout with brown dots. It appears, as if he had freckles.
        Another thing I just adore are his ears. He's like dumbo, he has very big, fluffy ears.
        <br><br>
        Beagles are hounds and you can really notice that. He's very active, always chases birds in the garden (he's the best scarecrow you can get! ;D).
        Furthermore, when we go for a walk, his nose is always on the ground. He sniffles and grunts at the same time, as if he was a pig! 
        The moment he sees another dog, a cat, a chicken or a deer for example, he gets really excited and wants to chase it for every price. 
        That can be really really exhausting! But that's just his nature and there's nothing we can do about it.
